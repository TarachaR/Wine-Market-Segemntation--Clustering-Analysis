## Background Information
Champagne Company is a leading wine company that specialises in the importation and distribution of premium and super-premium wines, champagnes and spirits within the East African region. The main goal of the company is to make the most exclusive brands of wine more accessible at an affordable price.

The company wants to satisfy the growing local demand for specialised products and the ever-increasing tourism industry where guests don ÃÅt want to settle for less.

## Understanding The Context

As a Data Scientist working for this company, my task is to perform wine segmentation given the provided dataset(s). The dataset(s) is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Kenya but derived from three different cultivars.

#### Technologies and Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Summary Of Findings
* We see that using k=3 is the best parameter to set when performing clustering on this dataset.

## Recommendations / Conclusions
While the two clustering models performed fairly well, I recommend further analysis and modeling to improve the solution until clear cluster boundaries are established.

## Challenging your Solution
Try out other clustering algorithms to see if they will improve the solution. Like:

* Affinity Propagation
* Birch Clustering
* DBSCAN Clustering

We can also try removing outliers and highly correlated variables to see if it will improve the model.
