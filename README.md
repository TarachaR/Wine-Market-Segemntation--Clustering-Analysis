## Background Information
The African Cancer Institute at Stellenbosch University aims to contribute to improving cancer prevention (both primary and secondary prevention, including screening), diagnosis and management in Africa. The institute is a coordinating and directive institution for research and training in the field of cancer within the University.

## Understanding The Context

As a Data Scientist working for the institution you have been tasked to identify factors that contribute to the death rate of cancer patients using collected dataset.
In addition, you have also been requested to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the death rate - **"TARGET_deathRate"**. You will be required to check for the assumptions of your model as well as perform k-fold (k=10) cross-validation while challenging your solution.

#### Technologies and Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Recording the Experimental Design
1. Load dataset and libraries.
2. Clean dataset.
3. Carry out data analysis.
4. Carry out data modeling.
5. Summarize findings.
6. Provide recommendations.
7. Challenge the solution.

While performing model selection/diagnosis, I performed the following steps in an effort to check for the following assumptions:

* Assess the linearity of the model (parameters)
* Assess heteroskedasticity
* Assess the normality of residual distribution
* Assess multicollinearity

## Summary Of Findings
* From our analysis and modeling, it is clear that the modeling algorithm is not a good fit for our data.

## Recommendations / Conclusions
I would recommend the company come up with either a different research question or get a different dataset.

## Challenging your Solution
* While the data was correct and valid, the research question was not appropriate for it, considering it had many outliers and was hence not suitable for linear regression.
