## Background Information
Champagne Company is a leading wine company that specialises in the importation and distribution of premium and super-premium wines, champagnes and spirits within the East African region. The main goal of the company is to make the most exclusive brands of wine more accessible at an affordable price.

The company wants to satisfy the growing local demand for specialised products and the ever-increasing tourism industry where guests don ÃÅt want to settle for less.

## Understanding The Context

As a Data Scientist working for the institution you have been tasked to identify factors that contribute to the death rate of cancer patients using collected dataset.
In addition, you have also been requested to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the death rate - **"TARGET_deathRate"**. You will be required to check for the assumptions of your model as well as perform k-fold (k=10) cross-validation while challenging your solution.

#### Technologies and Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

## Recording the Experimental Design
1. Load dataset and libraries.
2. Clean dataset.
3. Carry out data analysis.
4. Carry out data modeling.
5. Summarize findings.
6. Provide recommendations.
7. Challenge the solution.

While performing model selection/diagnosis, I performed the following steps in an effort to check for the following assumptions:

* Assess the linearity of the model (parameters)
* Assess heteroskedasticity
* Assess the normality of residual distribution
* Assess multicollinearity

## Summary Of Findings
* From our analysis and modeling, it is clear that the modeling algorithm is not a good fit for our data.

## Recommendations / Conclusions
I would recommend the company come up with either a different research question or get a different dataset.

## Challenging your Solution
* While the data was correct and valid, the research question was not appropriate for it, considering it had many outliers and was hence not suitable for linear regression.
